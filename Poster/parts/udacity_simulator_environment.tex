Udacity provides a free and easy to use platform for testing and gathering data in autonomous driving tasks.
It encompasses the following set of features:
\begin{itemize}	
	\item Compatible with both Windows and Linux systems(compared to GTA V)
	\item Built-in
		\subitem Data Collection Mode
		\subitem Autonomous Driving Mode
	\item Customizable through Unity
\end{itemize}
The data gathering is done by capturing the screen output and the steering angle input from a user. This data is saved in the form of the screenshots, each one annotated with the steering angle value, which can then be used for training.
